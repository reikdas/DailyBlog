title:      clang and Awkward Array tests (Blog revival?)

clang
* Tested my suffix patch by removing the check for DeducedType -> Seems to be failing tests that should pass.
* Posted on cfe-dev about my problem; hoping someone will be able to help. Maybe I should have cc'd Vassil...

Awkward Array
* Finished test generator for kernels in reducers
* Kernels in sorting is difficult because I will have to make my C++ parser get type and template information from sorting.cpp and sorting.h.
* Asked Jim if we should merge the PR now -> Waiting for his response. It is not a blocker, but maybe he has some thoughts I would need to address first.

I am probably going to revive this blog (although it is probably a daily journal at this point).
