Made some progress with my understanding of pycparser. 

Cling's cpt installer has a bug - sometimes reverts to using the system installed LLVM inspite of being given a flag to use a downloaded LLVM tar. This is hard to reproduce.
Cling's tests in its current form require sudo to be executed (bug introduced by LLVM binary dependence PR) - Tried to set up fresh Ubuntu 16.04 and 14.04 installs on both my laptops to add some fixes, but failed to build Cling successfully(!)

Saw some rudimentary videos on the introductory chapters(Units of Information, Hamming Distance and code classification) on Information Theory.

Made some small tweaks to get this Blog functional.
